    "Guido van Rossumbegan working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to theABCprogramming language and first released it in 1991 as Python\u00a00.9.0.[36]Python\u00a02.0 was released in 2000. Python\u00a03.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completelybackward-compatiblewith earlier versions. Python\u00a02.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python\u00a02.[37]",
    "Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in themachine learningcommunity.[38][39][40][41]",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42]byGuido van RossumatCentrum Wiskunde & Informatica(CWI) in theNetherlandsas a successor to theABCprogramming language, which was inspired bySETL,[43]capable ofexception handlingand interfacing with theAmoebaoperating system.[12]Its implementation began in December\u00a01989.[44]Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[45](he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\"). In January\u00a02019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]",

    "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such aslist comprehensions,cycle-detectinggarbage collection,reference counting, andUnicodesupport.[49]Python 2.7'send-of-lifewas initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python\u00a03.[50][51]It no longer receives security patches or updates.[52][53]While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation,PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) \"backportedsecurity updates\".[54]",
    "Python\u00a03.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with some new semantics and changed syntax. At least every Python release since (now unsupported) 3.5 has added some syntax to the language, and a few later releases have dropped outdated modules, and changed semantics, at least in a minor way.",
    "As of 12\u00a0March\u00a02025[update], Python 3.13 is the latest stable release. Python 3.13 currently receives full bug-fix and security updates, while Python 3.12\u2014released in October 2023\u2014will have active bug-fix support only until April 2025. Python 3.9[55]is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.8 reachingend-of-life.[56][57]Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half), followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",
    "Security updates were expedited in 2021 (and again twice in 2022, and more fixed in 2023 and in September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20), since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[58]) because of security issues leading to possibleremote code execution[59]andweb-cache poisoning.[60]",

Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[62]Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages (again improved in 3.14), and many other changes.",
    "Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for types, a new and improved interactive interpreter (REPL), featuring multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector (producing shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects, and addition to the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12),  and anexperimentaljust-in-time (JIT) compiler(such features, can/needs to be enabled specifically for the increase in speed),[63]and anexperimentalfree-threaded build mode, which disables theglobal interpreter lock(GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature enabled withpython3.13torpython3.13t.exe.",

    "Python is amulti-paradigm programming language.Object-oriented programmingandstructured programmingare fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming andaspect-oriented programming(includingmetaprogramming[71]andmetaobjects).[72]Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, includingdesign by contract[73][74]andlogic programming.[75]Python is often referred to as a'glue language'[76]because it can seamlessly integrate components written in other languages.",
    "Python usesdynamic typingand a combination ofreference countingand a cycle-detecting garbage collector formemory management.[77]It uses dynamicname resolution(late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.",
    "Its design offers some support for functional programming in theLisptradition. It hasfilter,mapandreducefunctions;list comprehensions,dictionaries, sets, andgeneratorexpressions.[78]The standard library has two modules (itertoolsandfunctools) that implement functional tools borrowed fromHaskellandStandard ML.[79]",
    "Its core philosophy is summarized in theZen of Python(PEP 20), which includesaphorismssuch as:[80]",
    "However, Python features regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat.[81]Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.[82]The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.[83][84]",
    "Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highlyextensiblevia modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations withABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[42]",
    "Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast toPerl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one\u2014and preferably only one\u2014obvious way to do it.\" philosophy.[80]In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.[85]Alex Martelli, aFellowat thePython Software Foundationand Python book author, wrote: \"To describe something as 'clever' isnotconsidered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[86]",
    "Python's developers usually strive to avoidpremature optimizationand reject patches to non-critical parts of theCPythonreference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[87]Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using ajust-in-time compilerlikePyPy. It is also possible tocross-compile to other languages, but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a verydynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.[88]",
    "Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name\u2014a tribute to the British comedy groupMonty Python[89]\u2014and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (a reference toa Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used\"foo\" and \"bar\".[90][91]A commonneologismin the Python community ispythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. \"Pythonic\" code may use Pythonidiomswell, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.[92]",
    "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not usecurly bracketsto delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases thanCorPascal.[93]",
    "Python useswhitespaceindentation, rather thancurly bracketsor keywords, to delimitblocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[94]Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[95]This feature is sometimes termed theoff-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[96]",
    "Python'sstatementsinclude:",
    "The assignment statement (=) binds a name as areferenceto a separate, dynamically allocatedobject. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixeddata type; however, it always refers tosomeobject with a type. This is calleddynamic typing\u2014in contrast tostatically-typedlanguages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.",
    "Python does not supporttail calloptimization orfirst-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[99][100]However, better support forcoroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python'sgenerators.[101]Before 2.5, generators werelazyiterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python\u00a02.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[102]",
    "Python'sexpressionsinclude:",
    "In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such asCommon Lisp,Scheme, orRuby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:",
    "Statements cannot be a part of an expression\u2014so list and other comprehensions orlambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such asa=1cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.",
    "Methodson objects arefunctionsattached to the object's class; the syntaxinstance.method(argument)is, for normal methods and functions,syntactic sugarforClass.method(instance,argument). Python methods have an explicitselfparameter to accessinstance data, in contrast to the implicit self (orthis) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g.,C++,Java,Objective-C,Ruby).[111]Python also provides methods, often calleddunder methods(due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, inarithmetic operationsand type conversion.[112]",
    "Python usesduck typingand has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked atcompile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite beingdynamically typed, Python isstrongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.",
    "Python allows programmers to define their own types usingclasses, most often used forobject-oriented programming. Newinstancesof classes are constructed by calling the class (for example,SpamClass()orEggsClass()), and the classes are instances of themetaclasstype(itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming andreflection.",
    "Before version\u00a03.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax):old-styleandnew-style;[113]current Python versions only support the semantics of the new style.",
    "Python supportsoptional type annotations.[4][114]These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such asmypyto catch errors.[115][116]Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.[117]",

It also means that the equationb*(a//b)+a%b==ais valid for both positive and negative values ofa. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result ofa%bis, as expected, in thehalf-open interval[0,b), wherebis a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] whenbis negative.[123]",
